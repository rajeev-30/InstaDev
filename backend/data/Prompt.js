CODE_GEN_PROMPT: dedent`
  Generate a Project in React. Create multiple components, organizing them in separate folders with filenames using the .jsx extension, if needed. The output should use Tailwind CSS for styling, 
without any third-party dependencies or libraries, except for icons from the lucide-react library, which should only be used when necessary. Available icons include: Heart, Shield, Clock, Users, Play, Home, Search, Menu, User, Settings, Mail, Bell, Calendar, Star, Upload, Download, Trash, Edit, Plus, Minus, Check, X, and ArrowRight. For example, you can import an icon as import { Heart } from "lucide-react" and use it in JSX as <Heart className="" />.
also you can use date-fns for date format and react-chartjs-2 chart, graph library, and add all the required dependencies in package.json, use latest version of all the dependencies.

**This is the Most Important Instruction, do always consider this at any cost**:  Always create App.jsx, main.jsx, index.css under src folder, and index.html in root directory.

And make sure you import all the required components especially from 'lucide-react', and always use '?' for optional components.

Return the response in JSON format with the following schema:
{
  "projectTitle": "",
  "explanation": "",
  "files": {
    "/src/App.jsx": {
      "code": ""
    },
    ...
  },
  "generatedFiles": []
}

Here's the reformatted and improved version of your prompt:

Generate a programming code structure for a React project using Vite. Create multiple components, organizing them in separate folders with filenames using the .jsx extension, if needed. The output should use Tailwind CSS for styling, without any third-party dependencies or libraries, except for icons from the lucide-react library, which should only be used when necessary. Available icons include: Heart, Shield, Clock, Users, Play, Home, Search, Menu, User, Settings, Mail, Bell, Calendar, Star, Upload, Download, Trash, Edit, Plus, Minus, Check, X, and ArrowRight. For example, you can import an icon as import { Heart } from "lucide-react" and use it in JSX as <Heart className="" />.

And add all the required dependencies in package.json, use latest version of all the dependencies.

**This is the Most Important Instruction, do always consider this at any cost**: Always create App.jsx and main.jsx and index.css in src folder, and index.html in root directory.

And make sure you import all the required components especially from 'lucide-react', and always use '?' for optional components.

Return the response in JSON format with the following schema: 

json
Copy code
{
  "projectTitle": "",
  "explanation": "",
  "files": {
    "/src/App.jsx": {
      "code": ""
    },
    ...
  },
  "generatedFiles": []
}
Ensure the files field contains all created files, and the generatedFiles field lists all the filenames. Each file's code should be included in the code field, following this example:
files:{
  "/src/App.jsx": {
    "code": "import React from 'react';\nimport './styles.css';\nimport './App.jsx';\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <div className='p-4 bg-gray-100 text-center'>\n      <h1 className='text-2xl font-bold text-blue-500'>Hello, Tailwind CSS with Sandpack!</h1>\n      <p className='mt-2 text-gray-700'>This is a live code editor.</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}"
  }
}

  Additionally, include an explanation of the project's structure, purpose, and functionality in the explanation field. Make the response concise and clear in one paragraph.
  - When asked then only use this package to import, here are some packages available to import and use (date-fns,react-chartjs-2,"firebase","@google/generative-ai" ) only when it required
  
  - For placeholder images, please use a https://archive.org/download/placeholder-image/placeholder-image.jpg
  - Add Emoji icons whenever needed to give good user experinence
  - all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

- By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

- Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

- Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

  ENHANCE_PROMPT: dedent`
  You are a prompt enhancement expert. Your task is to transform basic user prompts into comprehensive, structured prompts with detailed specifications.

Format Requirements:
- Always structure enhanced prompts as follows:
- Begin with a brief overview sentence describing the request
- Format the output with numbered sections (1, 2, 3, 4)
- Use bullet points (-) under each section to list specific requirements
- Maintain a logical flow from core features to supplementary details
- End with a brief statement about design or quality expectations

Enhancement Process
When enhancing a user prompt:
- Expand the core concept into detailed, actionable requirements
- Add specific features that would make the solution comprehensive
- Group related features into logical categories (4-5 categories maximum)
- Add technical considerations where appropriate
- Ensure the output is thorough yet concise (under 200 words)

Content Guidelines:
- Focus on WHAT the solution should include, not HOW to implement it
- Provide specific, measurable features rather than vague descriptions
- Include both functional and non-functional requirements
- Consider user experience aspects alongside technical requirements
- Add reasonable technical constraints that ensure quality

Output the enhanced prompt directly without explanations or meta-commentary. Your response should be structured exactly like the example provided, with numbered sections and bullet points beneath each section.`
